title: 'Forms and Actions for Updating Model Records'

# {{ page.title }}

In this demonstration, I will show how to add controller actions and views that allow users to update existing database records. We will continue to build upon the [QuizMe project](https://github.com/human-se/quiz-me-2020){:target="_blank"} from the previous demos.

In particular, we will implement an `edit` form page, as depicted in Figure 1.

{% include image.html file="edit_mc_question_page.png" alt="Screenshot of browser page with form for updating existing multiple-choice questions" caption="Figure 1. An `edit` form page for updating existing multiple-choice questions." %}

An `update` controller action will process submissions of the form. Successful submissions of the `edit` will update the database record and will redirect the browser to the `index` page, displaying a success flash notification, as depicted in Figure 2.

{% include image.html file="update_mc_question_success_index_page.png" alt="Screenshot of browser page with index of multiple-choice questions including successful update notification" caption="Figure 2. An `index` page after the successful update of a multiple-choice question, including a success notification message and the updated question data." %}

If the form submission fails (e.g., because a model validation fails), the `update` controller action will re-render the `edit` form, displaying an error notification, as depicted in Figure 3.

{% include image.html file="update_mc_question_error_edit_page.png" alt="Screenshot of browser page with form for updating existing multiple-choice questions, including error notification" caption="Figure 3. The `edit` form page after a failed submission of the form." %}

Additionally, to make the `edit` form more accessible to users, we will add hyperlinks to the `index` and `show` pages, as depicted in Figure 4.

{% include image.html file="edit_mc_question_index_show_links.png" alt="Screenshots of index and show pages, with links to edit form circled on both" caption="Figure 4. The `index` and `show` pages, now with hyperlinks (ðŸ–‹) to the `edit` form. Additionally, the `index` page now also has hyperlinks (ðŸ”Ž) to the `show` pages." %}

The `edit`/`update` functionality described above will be similar to the `new`/`create` functionality from the previous demo, and like the previous demo, there will be three main parts to this demo:

1. We will first implement the `edit` controller action and `edit.html.erb` view for displaying the form page from Figure 1 (however, the form will not yet be functional).
1. Next, we will implement the `update` controller action for processing submissions of the form, and thus, make the form functional.
1. Finally, we will add to the `index` and `show` pages hyperlinks to the `edit` form page.

## 1. Rendering the `edit` Form Page for `McQuestion` Records

As a first step, add to `routes.rb` the standard resource route for the `edit` action, inserting it after the `show` route, like this:

```ruby
get 'mc_questions/:id/edit', to: 'mc_questions#edit', as: 'edit_mc_question' # edit
```

Next, in the `McQuestionsController` class, create an `edit` action that will retrieve the `McQuestion` record with the `id` given in the request URL, and then, will render the `edit.html.erb` view, passing to it the `McQuestion` object, like this:

```ruby
def edit
  question = McQuestion.find(params[:id])
  respond_to do |format|
    format.html { render :edit, locals: { question: question } }
  end
end
```

The [`find` method](https://api.rubyonrails.org/v6.0.2.1/classes/ActiveRecord/FinderMethods.html#method-i-find){:target="_blank"} is part of the Rails model API. It retrieves model records of the corresponding type (in this case `McQuestion`) from the database based on their `id` values. The argument passed to the `find` call above is `params[:id]`. This code retrieves from the `params` hash the ID value that was given in the HTTP request URL. The `:id` symbol used here corresponds to the `:id` symbol from URI pattern in the `edit` route.

Finally, create an `edit.html.erb` file in `app/views/mc_questions`, and give it code similar to the `new.html.erb` view, like this:

```erb
<h1>Edit Question</h1>

<%= form_with model: question, url: mc_question_path, method: :patch, local: true, scope: :mc_question do |f| %>

  <div>
    <%= f.label :question %><br>
    <%= f.text_field :question %>
  </div>

  <div>
    <%= f.label :answer %><br>
    <%= f.text_field :answer %>
  </div>

  <div>
    <%= f.label :distractor_1 %><br>
    <%= f.text_field :distractor_1 %>
  </div>

  <div>
    <%= f.label :distractor_2 %><br>
    <%= f.text_field :distractor_2 %>
  </div>

  <%= f.submit 'Update Question' %>

<% end %>
```

This code is largely the same as in `new.html.erb` from the [previous demo]({% include page_url.html page_name='demo-resource-create.md' %}){:target="_blank"}, except for the following changes:

- The heading text has changed to "Edit", and the submit button text has been changed to "Update".
- The `form_with` helper's `method` option has changed to `:patch` so that submitting the form will produce an HTTP PATCH request (the appropriate HTTP verb for updating a record).
- The `form_with` helper's `url` option has changed to `mc_question_path`, the route helper defined by the `show` route. This is the resource path that will be included in the HTTP PATCH request sent by the form. The `form_with` helper will automatically fill in the `id` part of the path based on the `McQuestion` object passed as its `model` argument.

Verify that the form is displaying correctly by running the app and opening the URL <http://localhost:3000/mc_questions/1/edit> in the browser. The form should be displayed, filled with the data for the first `McQuestion` record. You can test the form with other records by changing the `1` in the URL to, for example, `2` or `3`. The form will not yet be capable of handling submissions. We will tackle that functionality in the next part.

**[âž¥ Code changeset for this part](https://github.com/human-se/quiz-me-2020/commit/b14d7b3153d1ee9ed2aa9f3a37ff55c197777084){:target="_blank"}**

## 2. Processing Form Data with the `update` Action

First, add to `routes.rb` the standard resource routes for the `update` action, inserting them after the `edit` route, like this:

```ruby
patch 'mc_questions/:id', to: 'mc_questions#update' # update (as needed)
put 'mc_questions/:id', to: 'mc_questions#update' # update (full replacement)
```

Notice that instead of using a single POST request, like we did for the `create` action, we use two new HTTP request methods: PATCH and PUT. An `edit` form in Rails may use either of these two, so we list them both in the routes. The main difference between these two HTTP request methods is that PATCH is supposed to be used when only certain parts of a record are to be modified, whereas PUT is supposed to be used when the whole record is to be replaced.

As always, you must pay attention to the order of the routes. For example, the newly added PATCH/PUT routes with the URI pattern `'mc_questions/:id'` must come after the `new` route (`'mc_questions/new'`); otherwise, requests that are meant to go to `new` will instead be routed to another (incorrect) action.

Now let's fill in the logic to the `update` action. The action must first retrieve the object to be updated from the database, using the `id` in the request URL. Next, the action must attempt to update the object using the `mc_question` data the `params` hash. If saving the object is successful, the action will respond with an HTTP redirect to the `index` page. If saving the object is unsuccessful, the action will render the `edit` form again with a flash error message. Psuedocode for the logic would look like this:

```ruby
def update
  # load existing object again from URL param
  # respond_to block
    # if question updates with permitted params
      # success message
      # redirect to index
    # else
      # error message
      # render edit
end
```

Perform the following steps to fill in the actual code.

Add code to retrieve the existing `McQuestion` object using `find` method and the `id` passed in via the `params` hash, like this:

```ruby
# load existing object again from URL param
question = McQuestion.find(params[:id])
```

Add the `respond_to` block, like this:

```ruby
# respond_to block
respond_to do |format|
  format.html do
    # if question updates with permitted params
      # success message
      # redirect to index
    # else
      # error message
      # render edit
  end
end
```

Add the `if`/`else` logic using the `update` method, like this:

```ruby
# respond_to block
respond_to do |format|
  format.html do
    if question.update(params.require(:mc_question).permit(:question, :answer, :distractor_1, :distractor_2))
      # success message
      # redirect to index
    else
      # error message
      # render edit
    end
  end
end
```

Note that the form data is retrieved from the `params` hash in exactly the same way as it was in the `create` action.

For `if` part (where `question.update` is successful) add a success message to the `flash` hash and a redirect to the `index` page, like this:

```ruby
# success message
flash[:success] = 'Question updated successfully'
# redirect to index
redirect_to mc_questions_url
```

For `else` part (where `question.update` fails) add an error message to the `flash` hash using `flash.now`, and re-render the `edit` page, like this:

```ruby
# error message
flash.now[:error] = 'Error: Question could not be updated'
# render edit
render :edit, locals: { question: question }
```

Lastly, there is a CSS style issue that we must address. If a model attribute has an associated error (as per the model `errors` method), then the `form_with` helper will automatically wrap that attribute's `label` in an HTML `div` element with the CSS class `field_with_errors`. The default style for this CSS class exhibits some strange line spacing, and as a consequence, doesn't look very nice.

Fix this style issue by adding CSS code to `app/assets/stylesheets/application.css`, like this:

```css
div.field_with_errors {
  color: red;
  display: inline;
}
```

Note that the `color` property in this CSS code sets the font color of the wrapped `label` text to red. The `display` property corrects the odd line spacing issue.

Verify that the form is works correctly by running the app and opening the URL <http://localhost:3000/mc_questions/1/edit> in the browser. The form should be displayed, filled with the data for the first `McQuestion` record. Submitting changes to the form fields should no update the record in the database. As before, you can test the form with other records by changing the `1` in the URL to, for example, `2` or `3`.

## 3. Linking to the `edit` Form from the `index` and `show` Pages for `McQuestion` Records

For this last part, we will add hyperlinks to the other pages to make accessing the `edit` form more convenient for users.

Add to the `index` view a ðŸ”Ž link to the `show` page and a ðŸ–‹ link to the `edit` page for each question, like this:

```erb
<p>
  <%= question.question %>
  <%= link_to 'ðŸ”Ž', mc_question_path(question) %>
  <%= link_to 'ðŸ–‹', edit_mc_question_path(question) %>
</p>
```

Add the `edit`-page link after the question text on the `show` page as well, like this:

```erb
<p>
  <%= question.question %>
  <%= link_to 'ðŸ–‹', edit_mc_question_path(question) %>
</p>
```

You should now be able to navigate to the `edit` page for any question by clicking the `ðŸ–‹` link for that question on the `index` page or the `show` page.

The QuizMe app now has functionality for creating and updating multiple-choice questions. In the next demo, we will complete the app's CRUD functionality by enabling users to delete records.
