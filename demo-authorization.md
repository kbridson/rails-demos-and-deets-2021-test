title: 'Enforcing User Ownership of Resources'
---

# {{ page.title }}

In this demonstration, I will build upon the user-login functionality from the last demo by making it so that users have ownership of the quizzes they create (as well as the associated questions). Although one user may view the quizzes owned by another user, only the owner of a quiz will be allowed to edit or delete that quiz (or its associated questions).

To accomplish to implement such ownership, we will perform three high-level tasks:

1. Create an ownership association between `User` and `Quiz`, as depicted in Figure 1.
1. Update the existing pages and actions to use this new association.
1. Restrict permissions to the `new`/`create`/`edit`/`update`/`delete` controller actions for quizzes and for questions such that only the user who owns a quiz/question is permitted to execute those actions on the quiz/question.

{% include image.html file="user-quiz_class_assoc.svg" alt="Class diagram" caption="Figure 1. Model class design diagram showing the new ownership association between `User` and `Quiz`." %}

## 1. Creating an Ownership Association between `User` and `Quiz`

Create a new database migration to add the `User` FK column to `Quiz`. This involves several sub-steps.

Generate a new (empty) database migration by running the following command:

```bash
rails g migration AddUserFkColToQuizzes
```

Set up the migration to add a `user_id` FK column to the `quizzes` table by inserting the following line in the `change` method:

```ruby
add_reference :quizzes, :user, foreign_key: true
```

Update the database schema by running the migration with the following now-familiar command:

```bash
rails db:migrate
```

Set up the one-to-many association by adding `has_many` and `belongs_to` declarations to `User` and `Quiz`, respectively.

The `User` declaration should look like this:

```ruby
has_many(
  :quizzes,
  class_name: 'Quiz',
  foreign_key: 'user_id',
  inverse_of: :creator
)
```

The `Quiz` declaration should look like this:

```ruby
belongs_to(
  :creator,
  class_name: 'User',
  foreign_key: 'user_id',
  inverse_of: :quizzes
)
```

In the above declarations, note that a `Quiz` object will refer to its owner as `creator`, which is different from the Rails default name (`user`). For example, to retrieve the `User` that owns a `Quiz` referenced by a variable `quiz`, the method invocation would be `quiz.creator`. Also note that in Figure 1, the association end is labeled `creator` to capture this custom name.

Add some new `User` seed data, setting each user's password to "`password`" (which would be too insecure to deploy, but is easy to remember for purposes of testing/development), like this:

```ruby
u1 = User.create!(
  email: 'alice@gmail.com',
  password: 'password'
)

u2 = User.create!(
  email: 'bob@gmail.com',
  password: 'password'
)
```

Note that although the Devise `User` constructor has a `password` parameter that takes a clear-text password string, the password will actually be encrypted and saved in an `encrypted_password` attribute. It would be insecure for `User` objects to store clear-text passwords as attributes.

Update each `Quiz` in the seed data to be owned by a particular `User`, like this:

```ruby
q1 = Quiz.create!(creator: u1, title: 'MVC Concepts', description: 'This quiz contains questions related to the Model-View-Controller web application architecture.')
q2 = Quiz.create!(creator: u2, title: 'Rails Concepts', description: 'This quiz contains questions related to web application development using the Ruby on Rails platform.')
```

Remove all existing data from the database and re-seed it by entering this command:

```bash
rails db:seed:replant
```

To confirm that the data was seeded correctly, use pgAdmin to inspect the database, or use the Rails console, for example, to run `Quiz.all` and inspect the output.

## 2. Updating Existing Pages and Actions to Use the Association

### 2.1. Displaying the Quiz Creator on the `index` and `show` Pages for `Quiz`

Display the email address of each quiz's creator above the quiz's description on the `index` and `show` pages for `Quiz`, like this:

```erb
<p>
  Created by: <%= quiz.creator.email %>
</p>
```

Fix the [N+1 Queries Problem](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/v6.0.2.1/active_record_querying.html#eager-loading-associations){:target="_blank"} (discussed in [this previous demo]({% include page_url.html page_name='demo-has-many-forms.md' %}){:target="_blank"} that we now have by modifying the query in the `index` controller action, like this:

```ruby
quizzes = Quiz.includes(:creator).all
```

**[{% octicon git-commit height:24 class:"right left" aria-label:hi %} Code changeset for this part](https://github.com/human-se/quiz-me-2020/commit/cfc57e2f57b44f48e6bc098b4d1ac912294839d4){:target="_blank"}**

### 2.2. Adding a New `index` Page That Shows Only the Current User's Quizzes

The current `index` page for `Quiz` records displays all quizzes for all users; however, we would also like to have an `index`-style page that displays only the `Quiz` records owned by the currently signed-in user. To add this new `index` page, perform the following steps.

Generate a new `AccountQuizzesController` class by entering this now-familiar command:

```bash
rails g controller AccountQuizzesController
```

This controller will service requests for actions on `Quiz` records that are `User` specific. The rationale for having this separate controller is twofold. Firstly, it has more knowledge about the `User` model class than the plain old `QuizzesController` class; thus, the new controller helps to separate concerns. Secondly, adding this controller enables us to use only standard RESTful routes/actions (i.e., `index`, `show`, `new`/`create`, `edit`/`update`, and `destroy`). For example, if we were to instead add the new `index`-style action to the existing `QuizzesController` class, we would have to use a non-standard route, because the standard `index` route is already in use.

Add a route for the new user-specific `index` page, like this:

```ruby
get 'account/quizzes', to: 'account_quizzes#index', as: 'account_quizzes' # my quizzes page
```

Require users to be signed in in order to access the `AccountQuizzesController` actions by adding a `before_action` declaration to the controller class, like this:

```ruby
before_action :authenticate_user!
```

Add to the `AccountQuizzesController` class the new `index` action that will handle requests that match the new route, like this:

```ruby
def index
  # get all quiz objects belonging to current user
  quizzes = current_user.quizzes
  # display index view
  respond_to do |format|
    format.html { render :index, locals: { quizzes: quizzes } }
  end
end
```

Add the `account_quizzes/index.html.erb` view that will be rendered by the new `index` action, like this:

```erb
<h1>My Quizzes</h1>

<% quizzes.each do |quiz| %>
  <div id="<%= dom_id(quiz) %>">
    <br>
    <p>
      <%= quiz.title %>
      <%= link_to 'ðŸ”Ž', quiz_path(quiz) %>
      <%= link_to 'ðŸ–‹', edit_quiz_path(quiz) %>
      <%= link_to 'ðŸ—‘', quiz_path(quiz), method: :delete %>
    </p>

    <p>
      <%= truncate quiz.description, length: 75, separator: ' ' %>
    </p>
  </div>
<% end %>
```

Make it easier for users to navigate to the `index` pages for `Quiz` records (i.e., `QuizzesController#index` and `AccountQuizzesController#index`) by adding a hyperlink to each of those `index` pages to the `ul` list of links in `application.html.erb` that display at the top of each page, like this:

```erb
<li><%= link_to "Hi, #{current_user.email}", edit_user_registration_path %></li>
<li><%= link_to 'Quizzes', quizzes_path %></li>
<li><%= link_to 'My Quizzes', account_quizzes_path %></li>
<li><%= link_to 'Sign Out', destroy_user_session_path, method: :delete %></li>
```

### 2.3. Updating the `new`/`create` Page/Actions for `Quiz`

At this point, all the pages and actions for `Quiz` should still be functional, except the `new` and `create` actions. The reason that these actions are broken is because `Quiz` must now have a `user_id` in order for `save` to execute without a validation error. To solve this problem, we will update the `new` and `create` actions, and in the process, we will move those actions out of the `QuizzesController` class and into the `AccountQuizzesController` class.

Remove the `new` and `create` routes for the `QuizzesController`.

Add `new` and `create` routes for the `AccountQuizzesController`, like this:

```ruby
get 'account/quizzes/new', to: 'account_quizzes#new', as: 'new_account_quiz'
post 'account/quizzes', to: 'account_quizzes#create'
```

Move the existing `quizzes/new.html.erb` file to the `account_quizzes` directory, and change the form url to the new route, like this:

```erb
<%= form_with model: quiz, url: account_quizzes_path, method: :post, local: true, scope: :quiz do |form| %>
```

Comment out the existing `new` and `create` actions in the `QuizzesController` class, and add new ones to the `AccountQuizzesController` class, like this:

```ruby
def new
  # make empty quiz object
  quiz = Quiz.new
  # display new view
  respond_to do |format|
    format.html { render :new, locals: { quiz: quiz } }
  end
end

def create
  # new object from params
  quiz = current_user.quizzes.build(params.require(:quiz).permit(:title, :description))
  # respond_to block
  respond_to do |format|
    format.html do
      if quiz.save
        # success message
        flash[:success] = "Quiz saved successfully"
        # redirect to index
        redirect_to account_quizzes_url
      else
        # error message
        flash.now[:error] = "Error: Quiz could not be saved"
        # render new
        render :new, locals: { quiz: quiz }
      end
    end
  end
end
```

Add a "`New Quiz`" link to user-specific `index` page of quizzes by inserting a `link_to` call after the `h1` heading in `account_quizzes/index.html.erb` view, like this

```erb
<%= link_to 'New Quiz', new_account_quiz_path %>
```

Remove the "`New Quiz`" link from the `quizzes/index.html.erb` view. The rationale for this change is that creating a new quiz from a page where the user is viewing all the quizzes in the system (both theirs and everyone else's) might not make sense, and it's better to have the create-quiz link on the page that lists only the user's quizzes.

**[{% octicon git-commit height:24 class:"right left" aria-label:hi %} Code changeset for this part](https://github.com/human-se/quiz-me-2020/commit/95e74bf0e56f5c9c1fe1edab00c4c6a5e8a9cacb){:target="_blank"}**

## 3. Restricting Permissions on Controller Actions to Owners

Currently, it is possible for a signed-in user to edit and delete quizzes/questions that they don't own (e.g., by directly entering an `edit`-page URL into their browser's location/address bar with the ID of an arbitrary quiz/question). To fix this, we are going to (1) Add a new `before_action` to the `QuizzesController`, the `McQuestionsController`, and the `QuizMcQuestionsController`, and (2) we will display the edit and delete links on the `index` pages only when the current user owns the corresponding quiz/question.

Create a new function `require_permission` in the `QuizzesController` that will check that the current user owns a specified quiz, like this:

```ruby
def require_permission
  if Quiz.find(params[:id]).creator != current_user
    redirect_to quizzes_path, flash: { error: "You do not have permission to do that." }
  end
end
```

Note that if the current user is not the owner, then browser is redirected to to the `index` page for all `Quiz` records.

Add a `before_action` declaration at the top of the `QuizzesController` class definition that calls `require_permission` whenever any of the `edit`/`update`/`destroy` actions are invoked, like this:

```ruby
before_action :require_permission, only: [:edit, :update, :destroy]
```

Run the app to verify that the `ðŸ–‹` and `ðŸ—‘` links on <http://localhost:3000/quizzes> only work for quizzes the current user created.

Add the same `require_permission` method to the `QuizMcQuestionsController`. Also add the same `before_action`, except set it for only the `new` and `create` actions. Run the app to verify that a user cannot add a new question on the `show` page for a quiz they did not create.

Similar to above, create a new method `require_permission` in the `McQuestionsController` that will check that the current user owns a specified question, like this::

```ruby
def require_permission
  quiz = McQuestion.find(params[:id]).quiz
  if quiz.creator != current_user
    redirect_to quiz_path(quiz), flash: { error: "You do not have permission to do that." }
  end
end
```

Similar to above, add a `before_action` to the `McQuestionsController`, setting it for only the `edit`, `update` and `destroy` actions, like this:

```ruby
before_action :require_permission, only: [:edit, :update, :destroy]
```

Run the app to verify that the `ðŸ–‹` and `ðŸ—‘` links for the questions on the `show` page for `Quiz` objects only work for quizzes that are owned by the current user.

In the `quizzes/index.html.erb` view, display the `ðŸ–‹`, and `ðŸ—‘` hyperlinks only for the quiz owner by wrapping the links in `if` statements, like this:

```erb
<% if quiz.creator == current_user %>
  <%= link_to 'ðŸ–‹', edit_quiz_path(quiz) %>
  <%= link_to 'ðŸ—‘', quiz_path(quiz), method: :delete %>
<% end %>
```

Similarly, in the `quizzes/show.html.erb` amd `mc_questions/show.html.erb` views, display the "`New Question`", `ðŸ–‹`, and `ðŸ—‘` hyperlinks only for the quiz owner by wrapping the links in `if` statements, like this:

```erb
<% if quiz.creator == current_user %>
  <%= link_to 'New Question', new_quiz_mc_question_path(quiz) %>
<% end %>
```

```erb
<% if question.quiz.creator == current_user %>
  <%= link_to 'ðŸ–‹', edit_mc_question_path(question) %>
  <%= link_to 'ðŸ—‘', mc_question_path(question), method: :delete %>
<% end %>
```

With those steps completed, the QuizMe app should now be fully secured such that users are required to be authenticated in order to view most pages and the data that users create are protected against manipulation by other users.
