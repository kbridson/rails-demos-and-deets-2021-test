# Peer Evaluation of User Stories and Definitions

For this activity, your job is "grade" one or more teams' drafts of user stories and definitions.

## Grading Criteria

For each user story, address each and every one of the following criteria.

- **T**: Title and description templates. Mark all USs that don't follow the title and description templates provided in class.

- **S**: Not too big. USs should be short and capture only one feature. Mark any USs with long descriptions or that are really describing multiple features (i.e., ones that are _epics_).

- **F**: Functional user requirements. USs should contain only functional requirements (i.e., not _non-functional_ ones) and be user facing. Mark any USs that violate this rule.

- **C**: Customer-oriented. USs should not use terms and technologies unfamiliar to the customer. Mark all USs that violate this rule.

- **R**: No design, just requirements. USs should not inadvertently make design decisions. Thus, there should be no mention of implementation technologies or user interface buttons and widgets.

- **D**: Uses the definitions document. The definitions document should be used to define domain-specific or application-specific terms. Mark any such terms that are used in the USs that are not defined in the definitions. You should also note if any definitions are extraneous or unhelpful.

- **I**: Followed other instructions. Mark any failures to follow other instructions that were given for this assignment.

- **O**: Other issues. Mark things like bugs/errors/typos in USs or USs that are redundant.

Once you have evaluated all the USs, you should also fill out [this evaluation form](./07_user_story_peer_evaluation_form.pdf), which asked for more global feedback.
