# Think-Pair-Share Domain Modeling Activity

## Step 1: Think

Work silently on a domain-modeling problem (12 minutes).

## Step 2: Pair

Pair up with one other person on your team. If you have an odd number, form one triple.

Discuss your solutions to the problem (8 minutes). Look for discrepancies and misunderstandings. Agree upon a best final solution to the problem.

## Step 3: Share

I will randomly select students to answer questions about their process in solving the problem and to present their solutions to the class.
